# BACKEND RTLS DEVELOPER PRACTICAL TEST ‚Äì ORBRO

This project simulates a backend system that receives real-time logs from RTLS Tags, stores the latest state, and exposes a RESTful API for status queries. It is designed to run entirely on Ubuntu without requiring actual hardware devices.

### **‚ùì Question:** Explain the tag simulation method.

**‚úÖ Answer:**

The **tag simulation method** is implemented in the file `tag_simulator.py` and is responsible for mimicking real-time data emission from RTLS (Real-Time Location System) tags. It is designed to generate mock data that simulates real devices operating in a live environment.

**Key Features of the Simulation:**

1. **Multiple Output Methods:**

   * The simulator supports three output options:

     * `socket`: sends data over a TCP socket (default),
     * `stdout`: prints to the terminal,
     * `file`: writes to a log file (`tag_data.log`).
   * This flexibility allows integration with different backends.

2. **Simulated Tags with Configurable Intervals:**

   * It simulates **three different tags**, each with a unique transmission interval (e.g., 1s, 1.5s, 2s).
   * Each tag has its own thread and counter (`cnt`) that increases over time.

3. **Realistic Jitter and Randomness:**

   * The counter occasionally jumps by random values to simulate realistic signal fluctuation.
   * Transmission intervals also include small timing jitter (`¬±0.1s`), adding realism.

4. **Multi-threaded Simulation:**

   * Each tag runs in its **own thread**, allowing independent, parallel data generation.
   * This models the behavior of physical devices broadcasting asynchronously.

5. **Log Format:**

   * The simulator emits data in the format:

     ```
     TAG,<tag_id>,<cnt>,<timestamp>
     ```

     Example:

     ```
     TAG,fa451f0755d8,198,20250616110501.456
     ```

**Integration with Parser:**

The data emitted from the simulator is designed to be consumed by the log parser (see `parser.py`). The parser validates the format, checks for counter sequence consistency, and extracts tag metadata for further processing.


**Summary:**

The simulation approach closely replicates real RTLS tag behavior using multithreaded, jittered, and formatted data output. It serves as a realistic and flexible source for testing backend processing, validation, and API exposure in a development environment without physical devices.

### 2. TASK 2: API SERVER
üî¥ ***Important: Before run api server please shutdown task 1 first!***

#### 2.1. How to run API server

**Step 1: Run API Server**

```bash
python3 api.py
```

![6](asset/images/6.png)

**Step 2: Run Tag Simulator (in a separate terminal)**


```bash
# Socket mode (default)
python tag_simulator.py
```

![7](asset/images/7.png)



#### 2.2. API TESTING
**Register a Tag**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tags \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "fa451f0755d8", "description": "Helmet Tag for worker A"}'
```

**Get all Tags**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/tags
```

**Get a specific Tag**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/tag/fa451f0755d8
```

**Health Check**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

#### 2.3. Unit Testing (optional)

```bash
python3 test_api.py
```

### 3. TASK 3: Question:
**Review memory structure and propose improvements (30 minutes)**  
‚óè Analyze the following code snippet and identify at least **2 issues**, along with proposed solutions:

```python
tag_log = []

def log(tag_id, cnt, timestamp):
    tag_log.append((tag_id, cnt, timestamp))
```

**Answer:**

The above code has two critical issues related to **memory management** and **thread safety** that may affect system stability in a real-time backend application.


### Issue 1: **Unbounded Memory Growth (Memory Leak)**

#### Explanation:

* The `tag_log` list grows indefinitely with every `log()` call.
* In a real-world scenario, with tags sending data multiple times per second, this leads to **excessive memory consumption** and eventually crashes the system.

#### Solution:

Use a fixed-size buffer with `collections.deque` to retain only the most recent N entries.

```python
from collections import deque

tag_log = deque(maxlen=1000)  # Keeps the last 1000 log entries
```

---

### Issue 2: **Not Thread-Safe**

#### Explanation:

* If multiple threads log concurrently, appending to `tag_log` can result in **race conditions**.
* This can corrupt log data, cause inconsistent states, or crash the program unexpectedly.

#### Solution:

Use a `threading.Lock` to ensure safe concurrent access to the log buffer.

```python
import threading
from collections import deque

tag_log = deque(maxlen=1000)
log_lock = threading.Lock()

def log(tag_id, cnt, timestamp):
    with log_lock:
        tag_log.append((tag_id, cnt, timestamp))
```


## Improved Code

```python
from collections import deque
import threading

# Thread-safe, fixed-size log buffer
tag_log = deque(maxlen=1000)
log_lock = threading.Lock()

def log(tag_id, cnt, timestamp):
    with log_lock:
        tag_log.append((tag_id, cnt, timestamp))
```

This improved implementation ensures that the system remains **memory-efficient**, **stable**, and **safe in concurrent environments**.
